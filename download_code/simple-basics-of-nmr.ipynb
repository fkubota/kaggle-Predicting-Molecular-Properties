    "## Basic Principles of NMR\n",
    "\n",
    "NMR stands for **N**uclear **M**agnetic **R**esonance. In this section I'll cover each of three words and put them together.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Nuclear.** This word means that the phenomen appears on the level of nuclei of atoms. Let's consider the simplest nucleus all over the periodic table - nucleus of 1H isotope that is nothing more than just a single proton. The proton has a relative mass of nearly 1 and most importantly it has an electrical charge +1e (e ~ 1.6e-19 C).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Magnetic.** Proton rotates around its own central axis. Thus, a proton is said to have a nuclear spin. Any moving electrical charge is a source of a magnetic field. The orientation of created magnetic field depends on the nuclear spin. We can see analogy to the compass needle here. If nuclear spin equals +1 (nucleus rotates to the right), then the vector of magnetic induction **B** that defines the force of the field is oriented upwards. This vector is reffered to as *magnetic (dipole) moment*. Of course, the negative spin -1 leads to the opposite orientation of both nuclear rotation and direction of magnetic moment.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Proton Spin](https://images.slideplayer.com/23/6642593/slides/slide_3.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Resonance.** This is the effect that allows for determining molecular structures of many chemical compounds. We figured out that proton possesses electrical charge, and because it moves around itself, a magnetic field appears. Now, the nucleus starts to behave like a tiny magnet. Recall that if we have two magnets they can interact. The same is true even for such small magnets. In the wild, they interact with a natural magnetic field of the Earth. But we can put them into stronger magnetic fields generated by special instruments. If this happens, then any nucleus with a magnetic dipole moment has two possible magnetic states. Either they orient in the same direction as the external magnetic field, or in the opposite direction. The first case is preferrable due to *the minimum energy principle*. However, if we provide them with some extra energy (in NMR it is obtained from an alternating magnetic field that is perpendicular to the external constant field) they will consume the energy and orient against the external constant magnetic field. In this state, the nucleus is said to be in a magnetic *resonance* with the external magnetic field. This difference in energy between two states is detected in NMR spectroscopy and then it is converted to frequences (E = hv for waves). The stronger is an external magnetic field, the more signifiant is the energy gap between the two states, and the easier it is to measure it.\n",

    "An NMR spectrum looks like this. They are very useful when we need to determine a structure of a chemical compound. However, this effect is only possible with the atoms that possess a magnetic moment. These are all nuclei except for those with an even number of protons and an even number of neutrons.\n",

    "## Nuclear Shielding\n",
    "\n",
    "Until now we have considered a bare proton in a magnetic field. In most molecules this is very unlikely to happen. Molecules are merely a number of atoms that are hold together by some forces. And the atoms are nuclei surrounded by a bunch of electrons. Electrons move around the nucleus, and as you can guess, this movement also results in a new magnetic field. This magnetic field is said to be *induced* by electrons movements and thus is known as *induced magnetic field*. This induced field is oriented in a way to reduce the affection of the external magnetic field. In other words, electrons, moving around a nucleus, weaken the external magnetic field by creating another magnetic field oriented in the opposite direction. This effect is known as ***magnetic shielding***. The effect can be easily expressed in form of equation *B_effective = B_0 - B_induced*.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Magnetic Shielding in a Molecule](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/3-s2.0-B9780128007808000140-f14-07-9780128007808.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Magnetic shielding implies that the more electrons are moving around a certain nucleus, the more it is shielded. Therefore, the larger is B_induced, the less is B_effective, and finally the less is the energy of resonance and the corresponding frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "To keep atoms in a molecule together, there must be some forces that are responsible for this. These forces create chemical bonds between atoms. Most of chemical bonds in organic molecules are *covalent bonds*. They are comprised by a pair of electrons shared between two atomic neighbors each. Two electrons = one bond.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Scheme of Covalent Bonds in a Molecule of Water](http://science4fun.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/chemical-bonding-water-h2o.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "A bond between two atoms formed by only electron pair is called a singular bond. Sometimes two atoms share two or even three pairs. This implies that most of the time the electron pairs that form a bond can be found between the atoms that share this pair, and thus the pair is kind of located between two atoms. It is not necessary that they are located right in the middle of bond. Different atoms pull an electron pair with a different force. If pair(s) is/are skewed significantly from the middle, then we talk about a *polarized covalent bond*. This nformation about chemical boundaries is important to keep in mind."

    "## Chemical Equivalence\n",
    "\n",
    "So far you should realize that the magnetic environment of an atom impacts the resonance energy of the atom and why. Now we are going to see, how we can use it to predict NMR spectra!\n",
    "\n",
    "It is pretty obvious that if two atoms of the same chemical element in the same magnetic environment must have equal resonance energy. Here we only consider protons, so let's talk more about influence of environment. The question is how we determine whether two protons are in the same magnetic environment or not, i.e. whether they are ***chemically equivalent*** or not.\n",

The only difference to the real molecule is that hydrogen atoms are oriented in the corners of a right tetrahedron. It can be clearly seen that all four protons are in the same environment and thus are chemically equivalent.\n",

    "\n",
    "Propane has a chain of three carbon atoms supplemented with eight hydrogen atoms. Nonetheless, the number of different kinds of protons here is just two, not three. The reason is that a molecule of propane has a plane of symmetry that goes through the carbon atom in the middle. More generally, if a molecule has any element of symmetry and contains hydrogen atoms, it will have less groups of hydrogens than the number of atoms they are attached to. Molecules that have at least one element of symmetry are referred to as *achiral* molecules. You can read more about chiral/achiral compounds in the web, if you want to.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, when we can distinguish between different kinds of hydrogen in molecules, we need to say, that the number of these groups is equal to the number of signals in a PMR (Proton Magnetic Resonance - an NMR for protons) spectrum. Scroll up and see the spectrum for ethanol. Different types of hydrogen are highlighted with different colors."

    "## Chemical Shift\n",
    "\n",
    "I hope you recall the meaning of this phrase. I wrote that this is the frequncy of corresponding resonance energy, and I lied. But I lied only partly. Chemical shift *represents* the frequency in a slightly different way than just a raw frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "But why we sophisticate our life with some new fancy terms? It is all because the exact values of frequency depends on the external magnetic field that is generated during experiment, and hence it depends on the used instrument. It wouldn't be very useful if every time we obtained results on a different scale. The simple solutions that works perfectly is use of an etalon for conducted measurements of frequences. As the etalon, TMS (tetramethyl silane) is used most often, as its hydrogen atoms are shielded stronger than in most organic compounds. To compute chemical shift we use a simple formula *shift = registered frequency in Hz * 10^6 / frequency of instrument* and obtain the result in ppm (parts per million). Shifts in such relative unit will stay independent from the characteristics of an instrument used in an experiment."

Notice, the sign is in fact contextual.\n",
    "\n",
    "How then we assign it? You have already seen the simplest organic molecule - methane. In organic chemistry, inductive effect of a C-H bond of methane is 0. Substitution of one of these bonds by another atom or group of atoms leads to a product with general formula *X-CH3*. If substituion causes deshielding of remaining hydrogen atoms, such atom or group of atoms is said to be *electronegative* (in comparison with C-H bond) and demonstrates a *negative* inductive effect denoted *-I*. If introducing a substitute (atom or group of atoms) causes an opposite effect of auxillary shielding of protons, this substitute is said to be *electropositive* (in comparison with C-H bond) and demonstrates a *positive* inductive effect (*+I*). Relative strengths of many substitutes can be found in Google or any other search engine.\n",

It takes some time and many pictures to introduce these concepts. They help explain the mechanism of conjugation.\n",

    "Rules for determining the sign of the effect are the same as for the inductive effect. They differ however in ethalon (methan has no double or triple bonds). This time we consider product in general form of *X-CH=CH2*, where *X* is a substitute. If it pushes electrons towards another part of the molecule, it is a *positive* mesomeric effect. If it pulls electrons towards itself, it is a *negative* mesomeric effect."

Notice that we are only talking about the number of protons that belong to the same type. If we have more complicated case, when there are two different types of protons on both sides, the formula will be slightly modified and turned into a product *(n_1 + 1)(n_2 + 1)*, where *n_1* is the number of protons of the first type, and *n_2* is the number of protons of the second type.\n",
